This python application is intended to run on a raspberry pi, using the hq camera to take photos of stars and the moon. The raspberry pi is connected to 2 stepper motors, providing pan and tilt to the camera. For every 1 full rotation of the stepper motor, the pan and tilt are moved 1 degree. I need a python websocket server sending messages to a simple html page front end, a stepper motor controller where user can click buttons on html page that send websocket commands to server in order to adjust the motors. For now, just have placeholder functions for motor control. On start, it use the Astropy library and point at the current location of the moon, if the moon is currently visible
